    Download and run a constructor-like installer, patching

        URL pointing to a ``constructor``-like installer, such

    prefix

    env

        is first, but you can also add more if you need it. Take
        into account that no quote handling is done, so you need
        to add those yourself in the raw string. They will
        end up added to a line like ``exec env VAR=VALUE python3...``.
        For example, a value with spaces should be passed as::

    run_checks
        Run checks to see if installation was run previously.
        Change to False to ignore checks and always attempt
